Background
----------

This beamer theme is a custom theme, styled with simpliness in mind.
The design and first version without tikz was made by [Hermann Lorenz],
which was used in many student presentations between 2012 and 2014.
[Angelos] decided to refactor this theme utilizing tikz.

The example representation is compileable with PDFLaTeX and LuaLaTeX.
